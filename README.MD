# Dota 2 In-House League Headmin's Repo

### D2IHL
=================

* An NA Inhouse league for players below Ancient 5 (although players above can still join in on the fun and talk about the game/chat with people in general).
* For anyone below Ancient 5; Players up to Divine 5 can be vouched in on a case by case basis.
* Inhouses will be a semi-competitive atmosphere, similar to a Face-it League, and is mostly focusing on everyone trying to improve and have fun in a team atmosphere.

### Purpose of this repo
=================

To store whatever scripts or ideas we come up with that could automate some processes
